        <h1>Welcome to my favorite food page!</h1>
        <p>
            Everyone is born with a preference for sweet, which provides energy, and an aversion to bitter and sour,
            which may indicate poisonous or unripe food. We are also geared to like or not fatty and salty foods,
            which provide necessary minerals and calories. However, bitter tastebuds genetically differ for
            individuals, affecting which foods seem delicious or disgusting to our individual taste buds.

        <p>I like variety of food. I have many favourite dishes from different countries, but I prefere the Turkish
            and the Chines cuisine. I also like pastry. You can see some of the dishes below:
