        <p>
            Movies can entertain, educate, or explore critical social issues. Films can make us sit up and take notice,
            learn about a new culture, experience a different perspective, or open our eyes to a world we know nothing
            about. We watch movies because they're entertaining and make us think about issues in new ways.

                    In 2035, highly intelligent robots fill public service positions throughout the world, operating
                    under
                    three rules to keep humans safe. Despite his dark history with robotics, Detective Del Spooner (Will
                    Smith) investigates the alleged suicide of U.S. Robotics founder Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) and
                    believes that a human-like robot (Alan Tudyk) murdered him. With the help of a robot expert (Bridget
                    Moynahan), Spooner discovers a conspiracy that may enslave the human race.

                    Have you ever had a dream that you were so sure was real? What if you couldn't awaken? How would you
                    know

                    Neo (Keanu Reeves) to a forbidding underworld, he discovers the shocking truth--the life he knows is
                    the
